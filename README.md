# Meteorite-Fall-Data-Visualisation
A python visualisation project undertaken to answer the question "Are there factors that impact whether a meteorite has an observed fall?" by investigating factors such as meteorite mass, fall location, time of fall, and human population.

Programs to view graphs:
mass.py

Trends Noted (in order of graphs above):

    - Observed meteorites decents on average have a larger mass compared to unobserved decents.

    - Observed meteorite falls rise as time progresses, with an expansion of sightings branching primarily from Europe to other areas (India, North America, South America, Africa, and Australia), with their first sightings near coastal areas around their time of colonisations by Western Europeans. This indicates these meteorite sightings/recordings have been dependent on the expansion of the colonial empires.

    - Observed meteorite falls are dependent on population size (meteorite sightings follow population growth trend). 

    - All continents, excluding Africa, have less meteorite sightings in the last 50 years even though population is greater. This could be due to the increase in light pollution and the recent switch to LED lighting (which worsen the effects of light pollution).
